MERISKILL VIRTUAL INTERSNHIP DIABATES ANAALYSIS
the dataset has 768 records and 9 columns
** Objective: **

** Develop a predictive model using diagnostic measurements from the dataset to determine whether a patient is likely to have diabetes **.

Project Goals/Objectives:

Utilize Python Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient.
The prediction will be based on various medical predictor variables such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and other relevant features available in the dataset.

* Pregnancies=Nomber of preganat patients.
* Glucose=Plasma glocose concentration in oral glucose test.
* Blood pressure= Blood pressure.
* Skin thickness= Thickness of the skin fold.
* Insulin=Serum INsulin
* BMI=Body Mass INDEX(weight/height)
* .DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age=Age(years)
* Outcome=1 indicates presence of diabetes 0 indicates absense
INSIGHTS
The most influential factor for predicting diabetes is the 'Glucose' level.
'BMI' and 'Age' are also critical factors that significantly contribute to predictions.
